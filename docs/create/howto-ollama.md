# How to run a local model with Ollama

## Overview

This guide explains how to run a small local model using Ollama's CLI.
It is a good starting point for anyone looking to run a local model.

The guide works for any local system since it does not require a GPU
and runs on any operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).

## Before you start

This guide assumes you have a basic understanding of the terminal.

We recommend starting with a Qwen3.5 model. Select the specific model
based on the available RAM on your local system:

- Qwen3.5:2B for less than 16GB of RAM
- Qwen3.5:4B for 16GB+ of RAM

## Run the Qwen3.5 model

1. Install Ollama.

    Use [Ollama's installation instructions](https://docs.ollama.com/quickstart)
    for your operating system.

1. Run Ollama from the terminal. Type `ollama qwen3.5:2b` in the terminal.

    ```sh
    ollama qwen3.5:2b
    ```

    You should see a list of available commands.

    ```sh
    ❯ ollama
    Ollama 0.32.5

1. Type `qwen3.5:2b` to use the Qwen3.5:2B model.

    You will see this output:

    ```sh
    ❯ ollama
    ╭──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
    │ what changed on this branch?                                                 │
    ╰──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
      qwen3.5:2b
    ```

1. Enter a prompt in the text box.

    ```sh
    ❯ ollama
    ╭──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
    │ What standard library in Python is used to run asynchronous code             │
    ╰──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
      qwen3.5:2b
    ```

1. View the model's response.

    Congratulations! You have successfully run a small model locally on your machine.

1. Optional: Type another prompt.
1. Enter `/bye` to exit the prompt and then `ESC` to quit Ollama.
