# How to add a chat interface to Ollama with Open WebUI

## Overview

Running Ollama from the CLI is the quickest way to chat with a local model, but
it requires a terminal. [Open WebUI](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui) adds a browser-based chat interface on top of your local Ollama instance.

This guide is useful if you want to:

- use a local model but aren't comfortable with the terminal
- switch between models without typing commands
- upload documents and chat with them locally

## Before you start

If you haven't run a local model yet, start with
[How to run a local model with Ollama](howto-ollama.md).

You need Python 3.11 installed, to avoid compatibility issues.

Ollama must be running before you start Open WebUI. If you installed Ollamausing the previous guide it runs automatically in the background. You canconfirm it is running by visiting `http://localhost:11434` in your browser - you should see `Ollama is running`.

## Install and run Open WebUI

1. Install Open WebUI with `pip`. We recommend doing this inside a virtual
   environment to keep its dependencies separate from other projects.

```
pip install open-webui
```

2. Start Open WebUI.

```
open-webui serve
```

3. Open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

## Set up your account

1. Create an admin account on first launch. This account is local; no data leaves your machine.

2. Open WebUI will detect Ollama automatically. You should see your downloaded models available in the model selector at the top of the chat window.

3. Select a model and send a message to confirm everything is working.

## Troubleshooting

### No models appear in the selector

You need to have pulled at least one model with Ollama before Open WebUI can
list them. Run `ollama pull qwen3.5:2b` in your terminal, then refresh the
browser.

### Port 3000 is already in use**

Change the port mapping in the Docker command from `-p 3000:8080` to
`-p 3001:8080` (or any available port) and open `http://localhost:3001` instead.

## Stop and clean up

To stop Open WebUI when you are done: Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where Open WebUI is running.

## Next steps

- To let a coding agent drive your local model instead, see [How to run a local coding agent with Ollama in Docker](howto-ollama-docker-pi.md).
